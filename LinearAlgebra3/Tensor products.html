<h1> How to lose your fear of tensor products </h1>

<p> If you are not in the slightest bit afraid of tensor
products, then obviously you do not need to read this page.
However, if you have just met the concept and are like most
people, then you will have found them difficult to understand.
The aim of this page is to answer three questions: </p>

<ol>
 
1. What is the point of tensor products? <br>

2. Why are they defined as they are? <br>

3. How should one answer questions involving them? <br>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2> Why bother to introduce tensor products? </h2>

<p> One of the best ways to appreciate the need for a 
definition is to think about a natural problem and find
oneself more or less forced to make the definition in
order to solve it. Here, then, is a very basic question
that leads, more or less inevitably, to the notion of
a tensor product. (If you <em> really </em> want to lose
your fear of tensor products, then read the question and
try to answer it for yourself.) </p>

<p> Let V,W and X be vector spaces over R. (What I have 
to say works for any field F, and in fact under more general
circumstances as well.) A function f:VxW--&gt; X is called
<em> bilinear </em> if it is linear in each variable
separately. That is, f(av+bv',w)=af(v,w)+bf(v',w) and
f(v,cw+dw')=cf(v,w)+df(v,w') for all possible choices
of a,b,c,d,v,v',w,w'. </p>

<p> I shall take it for granted that bilinear maps are 
worth knowing about - they crop up all over the place - 
and try to justify tensor products given that assumption. </p>

<p> Now, bilinear maps are clearly related to linear
maps, and there are questions one can ask about linear
maps that one can also ask about bilinear ones. For
example, if f:V--&gt;W is a linear map between finite-dimensional
vector spaces V and W, then one thing we like to do is
<em> encode </em> it using a collection of numbers.
The usual way to do this is to take bases of V and W
and define a matrix A. To obtain the j<sup>th</sup> column
of this matrix, one takes the j<sup>th</sup> basis vector
e<sub>j</sub> of V, writes f(e<sub>j</sub>) as a linear
combination of the vectors in the basis of W, and uses
those coefficients. </p>

<p> The reason that the matrix encodes the linear map
is that if you know f(e<sub>j</sub>) for every j then
you know f: if v is a linear combination of
the e<sub>j</sub> then f(v) is the corresponding linear
combination of the f(e<sub>j</sub>). </p>

<p> This suggests two questions about bilinear maps: </p>

<ol> 
1. Can bilinear maps be encoded in a natural way using just a
few real numbers? <br>

2. Let V, W and X be finite-dimensional vector spaces, let
f:VxW--&gt;X be a bilinear map, and let 
{(v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>):i=1,2,...,n} be a collection
of pairs of vectors in VxW. When is f completely determined
by the values of the f(v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>)? <br>
</ol>

<p> The first question has an easy answer. Pick bases of
V, W and X. If you know f(v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>j</sub>)
whenever v<sub>i</sub> and w<sub>j</sub> are basis vectors
then you know f(v,w) for all pairs (v,w) in VxW - by bilinearity.
But each f(v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>j</sub>) is a vector in X and
can therefore be written in terms of the basis of X. Thus,
if the dimensions of V, W, and X are p, q and r respectively,
it is enough to specify pqr numbers (in a sort of 3-dimensional
matrix) in order to specify f. Furthermore, it is not hard to
see that every p-by-q-by-r grid of numbers specifies a bilinear
map : the number in position (i,j,k) tells us the k<sup>th</sup>
coordinate of f(v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>j</sub>). </p>

<p> This observation provides a partial answer to the second
question as well. If the pairs (v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>)
run over all pairs (e<sub>i</sub>,f<sub>j</sub>), where 
(e<sub>i</sub>) and (f<sub>j</sub>) are bases of V and W,
then the values of f(v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>) determine
f. However, this is not the only way to fix f. For example,
let V=W=R<sup>2</sup> and let X=R. Let e<sub>1</sub>=(1,0)
and e<sub>2</sub>=(0,1). If you know the values of
f(e<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>), f(e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>2</sub>)
f(e<sub>1</sub>+e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>+e<sub>2</sub>)
and f(e<sub>1</sub>+e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>+2e<sub>2</sub>)
then you know f. Why? Well, </p>

<p align="center"> f(e<sub>1</sub>+e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>+e<sub>2</sub>)
-f(e<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>)-f(e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>2</sub>)
=f(e<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>2</sub>)+f(e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>) </p>

<p> and </p>

<p align="center"> f(e<sub>1</sub>+e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>+2e<sub>2</sub>)
-f(e<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>)-2f(e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>2</sub>)
=2f(e<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>2</sub>)+f(e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>) </p>
 
<p> which allows us to work out f(e<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>2</sub>)
and f(e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>), and hence determines f. </p>

<p> On the other hand, f is not determined by 
f(e<sub>1</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>), f(e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>2</sub>)
f(e<sub>1</sub>+e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>+e<sub>2</sub>)
and f(e<sub>1</sub>-e<sub>2</sub>,e<sub>1</sub>-e<sub>2</sub>).
For example, if these values are all 0, then f could be identically
0 or it could be defined by f((a,b),(c,d))=ad-bc. </p>

<p> How, then, are we to say which sets of pairs fix f and which
do not? This is the point at which, if you do not know the answer
already, I would suggest reading no further and trying to work
it out for yourself. </p>

<hr>

<p> There is no doubt that what we are looking for is something
<em> like </em> a `basis' of pairs (v,w) in VxW. This should be
`independent' in the sense that the value of f on any pair cannot
be deduced from the value of f on the other pairs (or, equivalently,
we can choose the values of f at the pairs however we like), and 
`spanning' in the sense discussed above - that f is determined by its 
values on the given pairs. </p>

<p> Equally, there is no doubt that we are not looking for a basis
of the vector space VxW itself. For example, if V and W are both
R, then (1,0) and (0,1) form a basis of VxW, but to be told the
values of a bilinear map f:RxR--&gt;R at (1,0) and (0,1) is to be
told nothing at all, since they have to be 0. </p>

<p> To get a feel for what is happening, let us solve the problem
in this special case (that is, when V=W=R). Suppose we know the
value of f(a,b). We have just seen that this information is
useless if either a or b is zero, but otherwise it completely
determines f, since f(x,y)=(xy/ab)f(a,b). </p>

<p> Perhaps that was too simple for any generalization to suggest
itself, so let us try V=W=R<sup>2</sup>. Suppose that we know the
value of f(v,w). That tells us f(av,bw) for any pair of scalars
a and b, so if we want to introduce a second pair (v',w') which
is independent of the first (not that we know quite what 
this means) then we had better make sure that either v' is
not a multiple of v or w' is not a multiple of w. If we have
done that, then what can we deduce from the values of f(v,w)
and f(v',w')? Well, we have the values of all f(cv',dw'),
but unless v' is a multiple of v or w' is a multiple of w it 
seems to be difficult to deduce much else, because in order
to use the fact that f(x,y+z)=f(x,y)+f(x,z) or f(x+y,z)=
f(x,z)+f(y,z) we need to have one coordinate kept constant. </p>

<p> One thing we <em> can </em> say, which doesn't determine
other values of f but at least places some restriction on them,
is that </p>

<p align="center"> f(v+v',w+w')=f(v,w)+f(v,w')+f(v',w)+f(v',w'). </p>

<p> Since we know f(v,w) and f(v',w'), this means that f(v,w'),
f(v',w) and f(v+v',w+w') cannot be freely and independently chosen 
- once you've chosen two of them it fixes the third. But this 
isn't terribly exciting, so let's look at more pairs. </p>

<p> Because subscripts and superscripts are a nuisance in html,
I shall now change notation, and imagine that we know the values
of f(s,t), f(u,v), f(w,x) and f(y,z). If s, u and w are all multiples
of a single vector, then some of this information is redundant, 
since t, v and x are not linearly independent (they live in R<sup>2</sup>).
So let us suppose that no three of the first vectors are multiples
and no three of the second are. It follows easily that we can take
two pairs, without loss of generality (s,t) and (u,v), and assume 
that s and u are linearly independent, and that so are t and v. </p>

<p> We can now write w=as+bu, x=ct+dv, y=es+gu, z=ht+kv, and we
know, by bilinearity, that </p>

<p align="center"> f(w,x)=acf(s,t)+adf(s,v)+bcf(u,t)+bdf(u,v) </p>

<p> and </p>

<p align="center"> f(y,z)=ehf(s,t)+ekf(s,v)+ghf(u,t)+gkf(u,v). </p>

<p> Since we know f(s,t), f(u,v), f(w,x) and f(y,z), this gives
us two linear equations for f(s,v) and f(u,t). They will have
a unique solution as long as adgh does not equal bcek. In this
case we have determined f completely, since </p>

<p align="center"> f(a's+b'u,c't+d'v)=a'c'f(s,t)+a'd'f(s,v)
+b'c'f(u,t)+b'd'f(u,v), </p>

<p> the pair on the left hand side can be anything and
we know all about values of f on the right hand side. </p>

<p> Notice that if adgh does equal bcek then an appropriate
linear combination of the above two equations (ek times the
first minus ad times the second) gives a linear equation
that is automatically satisfied by f(s,t), f(u,v), f(w,x) 
and f(y,z). In other words, the pairs (s,t), (u,v), (w,x)
and (y,z) are not `independent', in the sense that f of
three of them determines f of the fourth. </p>

<p> So now we understand the case V=W=R<sup>2</sup> reasonably
well, but it is not quite obvious how to generalize the above
argument to arbitrary spaces V and W. Before we try, let us
think a little further about what we have already proved,
and how we did it. In particular, let us see if we can
be more specific about `independence' of pairs in VxW. </p>

<p> Why, for instance, did we say that (s,t), (u,v), (w,x)
and (y,z) were not `independent' when adgh=bcek? Was there
some `linear combination' that gave a `dependence'? Well,
I mentioned that there was a linear equation automatically
satisfied by f(s,t), f(u,v), f(w,x) and f(y,z). To be 
specific, it is </p>

<p align="center"> ekf(w,x)-adf(y,z)=(ekac-adeh)f(s,t)+
(ekbd-adgk)f(u,v). </p>

<p> This looks like a linear dependence between f(w,x), f(y,z), f(s,t)
and f(u,v), but it isn't quite that because these are just four real
numbers, and we are trying to say something more interesting than that
the dimension of R is less than 4. What we are saying is more like
this: if f is an <em> arbitrary </em> bilinear function, then the
above linear equation will <em> always </em> be satisfied. </p>

<p> How can we express that statement in terms of straightforward
linear algebra? Here are a few suggestions. </p>

<hr>

<h2> A first way of making sense of `independence' of pairs. </h2>

<p> We could think of f, in an expression like f(u,v), as standing 
for all bilinear functions at once. So then we would make a statement
like f(u,v)=2f(w,x) only if this equation was true for <em> every </em> 
f, rather than for some specific f. We could even make this
formal in a rather naughty way as follows. Let B be the set 
of all bilinear maps defined on VxW. (That's the naughtiness -
B is too big to be a set, but actually we will see in a moment that
it is enough to look just at bilinear maps into R.) Now regard
(u,v) as a function defined on B - if f is a map in B then
(u,v)(f) is just f(u,v). Then the statement that f(u,v) always
equals 2f(w,x) is the statement that (u,v), considered as a
function on B, is twice (w,x), considered as a function on B. </p>

<p> Just so that we don't have to keep writing the phrase
`considered as a function on B', let us invent some notation.
When I want to think of (u,v) as a function on B I'll
write [u,v] instead. So now the dependence that I wrote
earlier becomes </p>

<p align="center"> ek[w,x]-ad[y,z]=(ekac-adeh)[s,t]+
(ekbd-adgk)[u,v]. </p>

<p> This dependence really is genuine linear dependence,
in the vector space of functions from B to ... well, 
some rather complicated big sum of vector spaces or
something. Instead of bothering to sort out that 
little difficulty, let's see why it is in fact enough
to let B be the set of all bilinear functions to R,
otherwise known as bilinear forms. </p>

<hr>

<h3> Reducing to the case of bilinear maps into R. </h3>

<p> Here again there is an analogy with linear maps.
Suppose that V and W are finite-dimensional vector
spaces and f:V--&gt;W is a linear map. Let 
w<sub>1</sub>,...,w<sub>m</sub> be a basis for W.
If we write vectors in W in coordinate form using
this basis, then we will write f(v) as
(f<sub>1</sub>v,...,f<sub>m</sub>v), and in that
way we see that a linear map to an m-dimensional
vector space can be thought of as a sequence of 
m linear maps to R. </p>

<p> Exactly the same is true of a bilinear map
f:VxW--&gt;X if X is m-dimensional - we can
think of it as a sequence (f<sub>1</sub>,...,f<sub>m</sub>)
of bilinear maps from VxW to R. From this
observation we can make the following simple
deduction. If </p>

<p> a<sub>1</sub>f(v<sub></sub>,w<sub></sub>)+...+
a<sub>n</sub>f(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>)=0 </p>

<p> for every bilinear map f:VxW--&gt;R, then it is 
zero for every bilinear map from VxW to <em> any </em>
finite-dimensional vector space X. </p>

<p> In fact, one can even do away with the condition
that X should be finite-dimensional, as follows. 
If f:VxW--&gt;X is a bilinear map such that </p>

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>f(v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>)+...+
a<sub>n</sub>f(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>)=x </p>

<p> for some non-zero vector x, then let g be a
linear map from X to R such that g(x) is not zero.
The existence of this map can be proved as follows.
Using the axiom of choice, one can show that the
vector x can be extended to a basis of X. Let g(x)=1,
let g(y)=0 and extend linearly. Once we have g, we
have a bilinear map gf:VxW--&gt;R such that </p> 

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>gf(v<sub></sub>,w<sub></sub>)+...+
a<sub>n</sub>gf(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>) </p>

<p> is non-zero. </p>

<p> This use of the axiom of choice was not very
pleasant, but we shall soon see that it can be avoided. </p>

<hr>

<h3> Back to the main discussion. </h3>

<p> Let us therefore redefine B to be the set of all bilinear
maps from VxW to R, and regard [v,w] as notation for the 
function from B to R defined by [v,w](f)=f(v,w). (This is
the same definition as before, apart from the restriction
of B to real-valued bilinear maps.) Now that [v,w] is a
function from B to R it is completely clear in what sense
it lives in a vector space, what is meant by linear
dependence and so on. Everything takes place inside the
vector space of all real-valued functions on B. </p>

<p> The idea of defining functions such as [v,w] was that
it gave us a way of reformulating our original problem -
when does a set of pairs (v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>)
fix all bilinear maps? - in terms of concepts we know
from linear algebra - it fixes all bilinear maps if and
only if the vector space spanned by the functions
[v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>] contains all functions
of the form [v,w]. Moreover, the set of pairs contains
no redundancies if and only if the functions 
[v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>] are linearly independent. </p>

<hr>

<h2> A second way of converting the problem into linear algebra. </h2>

<p> Have we really said anything at all? It might seem
not. After all, if we are given a set of pairs 
(v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>) and asked whether the
corresponding functions [v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>]
span all functions [v,w], we will find ourselves 
making exactly the same calculations that we would
make if instead we asked whether the values of
f(v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>), for some unknown
bilinear function f, determined the value of f(v,w). </p>

<p> However, turning the problem into linear algebra
does clarify it somewhat, especially if we can say
something about the vector space generated by the
functions [v,w] (which contains all the functions
on B we will ever need to worry about). It also 
gives us a more efficient notation. </p>

<p> Let me write down a few facts about this vector
space. </p>

<ol>

1. [v,w+w']=[v,w]+[v,w'] <br>
2. [v+v',w]=[v,w]+[v',w] <br>
3. [av,w]=a[v,w] <br>
4. [v,aw]=a[v,w] <br>
</ol>

<p> The above relations hold for all vectors v,v' in V and
w,w' in W, and all real numbers a. Now if we regard an equation
like [v,w+w']=[v,w]+[v,w'] as nothing but a shorthand for the
statement that f(v,w+w')=f(v,w)+f(v,w') for all bilinear maps
f, then it would seem that everything about the space spanned
by the functions [v,w] ought to follow from these four facts.
After all, the linear relationships between the functions
[v,w] are supposed to be the ones that we can deduce about
the corresponding vectors f(v,w) when <em> all </em> we know 
about f is that it is bilinear. So they ought to follow from the
axioms for bilinearity - which translate into facts 1-4 above. </p>

<p> Let us try to make this hunch precise and prove it. 
To do this we must ask ourselves which linear dependences
can be deduced from 1-4, and then whether those are all the
linear relationships that hold for every bilinear function. 
In a moment I will express this less wordily, but for now
let us note that the first question is easy. Facts 1-4
give us four linear equations, which we can make a bit
more symmetrical by rewriting them as </p>

<ol>

1. [v,w+w']-[v,w]-[v,w']=0 <br>
2. [v+v',w]-[v,w]-[v',w]=0 <br>
3. [av,w]-a[v,w]=0 <br>
4. [v,aw]-a[v,w]=0 <br>
</ol> 

<p> Which other linear combinations of pairs must be zero
if these ones are? Answer: all linear combinations
of these combinations, and nothing else. This is because
the only method we have of deducing linear equations 
from other linear equations is forming linear combinations
of those equations. </p>

<p> There was something not quite satisfactory about what
I have just said. It does seem to be true, but let us try
to state and prove it more mathematically, without appealing
to phrases like `method of deducing'. It is certainly clear
that if </p>

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>[v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>]+
a<sub>2</sub>[v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>]+...+
a<sub>n</sub>[v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>] </p>

<p> is a linear combination of functions of the forms on the 
left-hand sides of 1-4 (in the second version), then 

</p><p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>f(v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>)+
a<sub>2</sub>f(v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>)+...+
a<sub>n</sub>f(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>)=0 </p>

<p> for every bilinear function f. What is not quite so obvious
is the converse: that for every <em> other </em> function of the 
form </p>

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>[v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>]+
a<sub>2</sub>[v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>]+...+
a<sub>n</sub>[v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>] </p>

<p> we can find some bilinear map f such that </p>

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>f(v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>)+
a<sub>2</sub>f(v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>)+...+
a<sub>n</sub>f(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>)</p>

<p> does not equal 0. However, it turns out that there is
an almost trivial way to show this. For every pair (v,w)
in VxW, regard [[v,w]] as a meaningless symbol. We can
define a rather large vector space Z by taking formal linear
combinations of these symbols. By that I mean that Z consists
of all expressions of the form </p>

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>[[v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>]]+
a<sub>2</sub>[[v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>]]+...+
a<sub>n</sub>[[v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>]] </p>

<p> with obvious definitions for addition and scalar multiplication. </p>

<p> Next, we let E be the subspace of Z generated by all 
vectors of one of the following four forms (which you should
be able to guess): </p>

<ol>

1. [[v,w+w']]-[[v,w]]-[[v,w']] <br>
2. [[v+v',w]]-[[v,w]]+[[v',w]] <br>
3. [[av,w]]-a[[v,w]] <br>
4. [[v,aw]]-a[[v,w]] <br>
</ol> 

<p> We want everything in E to `be zero', in some appropriate sense.
The standard way to make that happen is to take a quotient space
Z/E. (If you are hazy about the definition, here is a reminder.
Two vectors z and z' in Z are regarded as equivalent if z-z'
belongs to E. The vectors in Z/E are equivalence classes, which
can be written in the form z+E. That is, if K is an equivalence
class and z belongs to K, then it is easy to see that 
K={z+e: e is in E}=z+E. Addition and scalar multiplication
are defined by (z+E)+(z'+E)=z+z'+E and a(z+E)=az+E. It is
not hard to check that these are well defined - that is,
independent of the particular choices of z and z'.) </p>

<p> Why does this quotient space Z/E help us? Because it gives
us a trivial proof of the assertion we wanted before. If </p>

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>[v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>]+
a<sub>2</sub>[v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>]+...+
a<sub>n</sub>[v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>] </p>

<p> is not a linear combination of expressions of the
form </p>

<ol>

1. [v,w+w']-[v,w]-[v,w'] <br>
2. [v+v',w]-[v,w]+[v',w] <br>
3. [av,w]-a[v,w] <br>
4. [v,aw]-a[v,w] <br>
</ol> 

<p> then trivially </p>

<p align="center"> z=a<sub>1</sub>[[v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>]]+
a<sub>2</sub>[[v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>]]+...+
a<sub>n</sub>[[v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>]] </p>

<p> is not a linear combination of vectors of the form </p>

<ol>

1. [[v,w+w']]-[[v,w]]-[[v,w']] <br>
2. [[v+v',w]]-[[v,w]]+[[v',w]] <br>
3. [[av,w]]-a[[v,w]] <br>
4. [[v,aw]]-a[[v,w]] <br>
</ol> 

<p> In other words, z does not belong to the subspace E. 
In other words again, z+E is not zero in the quotient space
Z/E. To complete the proof, it is enough to find a bilinear
map f from VxW to Z/E such that </p>

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>f(v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>)+
a<sub>2</sub>f(v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>)+...+
a<sub>n</sub>f(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>)=z+E </p>

<p> and in particular is non zero. What is the most
obvious map one can possibly think of? Well, f(v,w)=[[v,w]]+E
seems a good bet. Is it bilinear? Yes, by the way we designed
E. For example, f(v,w+w')=[[v,w+w']]+E, and since 
[[v,w+w']]-[[v,w]]-[[v,w']] belongs to E, we may deduce that </p>

<p align="center"> f(v,w+w')=[[v,w]]+[[v,w']]+E=([[v,w]]+E)+([[v,w']]+E)
=f(v,w)+f(v,w') </p>

<p> To sum up, we have just proved the following (not very
surprising) proposition. </p>

<h3> Proposition </h3>

<p> <em> A linear combination of functions of the form </em> [v,w]
<em> is zero if and only if it is generated by functions of the
form </em> [av,w]-a[v,w], [v,aw]-a[v,w], [v,w+w']-[v,w]-[v,w']
<em> and </em> [v+v',w]-[v,w]-[v',w]. </p>

<h2> How to think about tensor products. </h2>

<p> What has all this to do with tensor products? Now is the
time to admit that I have already defined tensor products - in 
two different ways. They are a good example of the phenomenon
discussed in my page about <a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/definition.html">
definitions </a>: exactly how they are defined is not important:
what matters is the properties they have. </p>

<p> The usual notation for the tensor product of two vector
spaces V and W is V followed by a multiplication symbol with
a circle round it followed by W. Since this is html, I shall
write V@W instead, and a typical element of V@W will be a linear
combination of elements written v@w. You can regard v@w as an 
alternative notation for [v,w], or for [[v,w]]+E - it doesn't 
matter which as the above discussion shows that the space
spanned by [v,w] is isomorphic to the space spanned by 
[[v,w]]+E, via the (well-defined) linear map that takes
[v,w] to [[v,w]]+E and extends linearly. </p>

<p> A tempting mistake for beginners is to think that every element of
V@W is of the form v@w, but this is just plain false. For example, if
v, v', w and w' are vectors with no linear dependences, then v@w+v'@w'
cannot be written in that form. (If it could then there would be some
pair (v'',w'') such that a bilinear map f satisfied f(v'',w'')=0 if
and only if f(v,w)+f(v',w')=0. It is not hard to convince yourself 
that there is no such pair - indeed I more or less proved it in
the discussion above about two-dimensional spaces.) </p>

<p> Another tempting mistake is to pay undue attention to
how tensor products are constructed. I should say that the
standard construction is the second one I gave, that is, the
quotient space. Suppose that we try to solve problems by
directly using this definition, or rather construction.
They suddenly seem rather hard. For example, let v' and w'
be non-zero vectors in V and W. How can we show that
v'@w' is not zero? Well, to do so directly from the quotient
space definition, we need to show that the pair [[v',w']]
does not belong to the space E defined earlier. In order
to prove that, we somehow need to find a property of
[[v',w']] that is not shared by any linear combination of
vectors of the four forms listed above. </p>

<p> Let us ask ourselves a very general question: how does
one ever show that a certain point v does not lie in a certain
subspace W of a vector space? If the space is R<sup>n</sup>
and we are given a basis of the subspace, then our task
is to show that a system of linear equations has no solution.
In a more abstract set-up, the natural method - in fact,
more or less the only method - is to find a linear map
T from V to some other vector space (R will always be
possible) such that Tv is not zero but Tw is zero for
every w in W. </p>

<p> Returning to the example at hand, can we find a
linear map that sends everything in E to zero and 
[[v',w']] to something non-zero? Let us remind ourselves
of our earlier proposition.

</p><h4> Proposition (repeated) </h4>

<p> <em> A linear combination of functions of the form </em> [v,w]
<em> is zero if and only if it is generated by functions of the
form </em> [av,w]-a[v,w], [v,aw]-a[v,w], [v,w+w']-[v,w]-[v,w']
<em> and </em> [v+v',w]-[v,w]-[v',w]. </p>

<p> That gives us an obvious map that takes everything in 
E to zero: just map [[v,w]] to [v,w] and extend linearly.
So we are then done if [v',w'] is non-zero. But for [v',w']
not to be zero, all we have to do is come up with a 
bilinear map f from VxW to R such that f(v',w') is not
zero. To do this, extend the singletons {v'} and {w'}
to bases of V and W and for any pair of basis vectors
(x,y) let f(x,y)=0 unless x=v' and y=w' in which case
let f(x,y)=1. Then extend f bilinearly. </p>

<p> Well, we have solved the problem, but we didn't
really do it directly from the quotient-space definition.
Indeed, we got out of the quotient space as quickly as
we could. How much simpler it would have been to start
thinking immediately about bilinear functions. In order
to show that v@w is non-zero, we could have regarded it
as [v,w] instead, and instantly known that v@w is non-zero
if and only if there is a bilinear function f defined
on VxW such that f(v,w) does not vanish. </p>

<p> So, here is a piece of advice for interpreting a
linear equation involving expressions of the form v@w.
<em> Do not </em> worry about what the objects themselves
mean, and instead use the fact that </p>

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub>@w<sub>1</sub>+
a<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>@w<sub>2</sub>+...+
a<sub>n</sub>v<sub>n</sub>@w<sub>n</sub>=0 </p>

<p> if and only if </p> 

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>f(v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>)+
a<sub>2</sub>f(v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>)+...+
a<sub>n</sub>f(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>)=0 </p>

<p> for every bilinear function f defined on VxW. (We proved
this earlier, except that instead of 
v<sub>i</sub>@w<sub>i</sub> we wrote 
[v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>].) </p>

<p> Now algebraists have a more grown-up way of saying this,
which runs as follows. Here is a sentence from earlier in 
this page: </p>

<p align="center"> What we are saying is more like
this: if f is an <em> arbitrary </em> bilinear function, then the
above linear equation will <em> always </em> be satisfied. </p>

<p> It would be nice if there were a bilinear map g on VxW
that was so `generic' that we could regard it itself as
an `arbitrary' bilinear map. But there <em> is </em> such
a map, and we have more or less defined it. It takes
(v,w) to v@w. The bilinearity of this map is obvious
(if you don't find it obvious then you are forgetting to 
use the fact I have just mentioned and recommended).
As for its `arbitrariness', the fact above can be
translated as follows:

</p><p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>g(v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>)+
a<sub>2</sub>g(v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>)+...+
a<sub>n</sub>g(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>)=0 </p>

<p> if and only if </p> 

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>f(v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>)+
a<sub>2</sub>f(v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>)+...+
a<sub>n</sub>f(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>)=0 </p>

<p> for every bilinear function f defined on VxW. In brief, 
no linear equation holds for g unless it holds for all 
bilinear functions. </p>

<p> How do algebraists express this `arbitrariness'? They
say that the tensor product has a <em> universal property </em>.
The bilinear map g is in a certain sense `as big as possible'.
To see what this sense is, let us return to our main fact
in its v<sub>i</sub>@w<sub>i</sub> formulation. Let f:VxW--&gt;U
be some bilinear map, and let us try to define a linear map 
h:V@W--&gt;U by sending v@w to f(v,w) and extending linearly.
It is not quite obvious that this is well-defined, since
we must check that if we write an element of V@W in two 
different ways as linear combinations of v@ws, then the
corresponding linear combinations of f(v,w)s are equal.
But this is exactly what is guaranteed by the main fact. 
So h is a well-defined linear map, and hg=f, since
hg(v,w)=h(v@w)=f(v,w), by the definition of h. Moreover,
it is clear that h is the only linear map such that
hg=f, since h(v@w) is forced to be f(v,w) and we are
forced to extend linearly. We have therefore proved
the following. </p>

<h3> Proposition </h3>

<p> <em> For every bilinear map </em> f:VxW--&gt;U <em> there is a
unique linear map </em> h:V@W--&gt;U <em> such that </em> hg=f, <em> 
where </em> g <em> is the bilinear map from </em> VxW <em> to </em>
V@W <em> that takes </em> (v,w) <em> to </em> v@w. </p><p>

</p><p> The map f is said to <em> factor uniquely 
through </em> g. </p>

<p> Now let us see why this proposition says 
exactly the same as what I have called the main 
fact about V@W. Since it followed from the main
fact, all I have to do is show that reverse 
implication holds as well: assuming this proposition
we can recover the main fact. Suppose therefore
that there is a bilinear function f such that

</p><p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>f(v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>)+
a<sub>2</sub>f(v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>)+...+
a<sub>n</sub>f(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>) </p>

<p> is not zero. Since we can write f as hg, and since
h is linear, it follows that

</p><p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>g(v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>)+
a<sub>2</sub>g(v<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>)+...+
a<sub>n</sub>g(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>), </p>

<p> which equals </p>

<p align="center"> a<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub>@w<sub>1</sub>+
a<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>@w<sub>2</sub>+...+
a<sub>n</sub>v<sub>n</sub>@w<sub>n</sub>, </p>

<p> is also non-zero. And that establishes the fact. </p>

<p> A useful lemma about the tensor product is that it
is unique, in the following sense. </p>

<h3> Lemma </h3>

<p> <em> Let </em> U <em> and </em> V <em> be vector spaces, and let
</em> b:UxV--&gt;X <em> be a bilinear map from </em> UxV <em> to a vector
space </em> X. <em> Suppose that for every bilinear map </em> f <em>
defined on </em> UxV <em> there is a unique linear map </em> c <em>
defined on </em> X <em> such that </em> f=cb. <em> Then there is an
isomorphism </em> i:X--&gt;U@V <em> such that </em> u@v=ib(u,v) <em> for
every </em> (u,v) <em> in </em> U@V. </p>

<p> We can avoid mentioning u@v if we use the map g:UxV--&gt;U@V. 
Then the lemma says that g=ib. Briefly, the point of the lemma is
that any bilinear map b:UxV--&gt;X satisfying the universal property
is isomorphic to the map g:UxV--&gt;U@V in an obvious sense. </p>

<h3> Proof </h3>

<p> Applying the hypothesis about b to the bilinear map
g:UxV--&gt;U@V, we obtain a linear map i:X--&gt;U@V such that
g=ib. Similarly, applying the universal property of g
to the bilinear map b, we obtain a linear map j:U@V--&gt;X
such that b=jg. It follows that b=jg=jib. Now let c be
the identity on X. Then b=cb. So by the uniqueness part
of the hypothesis on X (applied when f=b) we find that
ji=c. Similarly, ij is the identity on U@V, which shows
that i is an isomorphism. </p>

<p> The reason algebraists prefer to talk about the
universal property of V@W and factorization of maps
is that it enables them to avoid dirtying their hands
by considering the actual <em> elements </em> of
V@W. It can be hard to get used to this 
spaces-rather-than-objects way of thinking, so let
me prove that the tensor product is associative (in 
the sense that there is a natural isomorphism between 
U@(V@W) and (U@V)@W), first by using the main fact and
then by using the universal property. </p>

<hr>

<h2> The associativity of the tensor product </h2>

<p> Since V@W is a vector space, it makes perfectly
good sense to talk about U@(V@W) when U is another
vector space. A typical element of U@(V@W) will
be a linear combination of elements of the form
u@x, where x itself is a linear combination of
elements of V@W of the form v@w. Hence, we can
write any element of U@(V@W) as </p>

<p align="center"> u<sub>1</sub>@(v<sub>1</sub>@w<sub>1</sub>)+...+
u<sub>n</sub>@(v<sub>n</sub>@w<sub>n</sub>). </p>

<p> (Here I have used facts such as that a(x@y)=x@ay=ax@y
and x@(y+z)=x@y+x@z.) Since we can say something very
similar about elements of (U@V)@W, there is a very tempting
choice for the definition of a (potential) isomorphism 
between the two spaces, namely that the above vector should
map to </p>

<p align="center"> (u<sub>1</sub>@v<sub>1</sub>)@w<sub>1</sub>+...+
(u<sub>n</sub>@v<sub>n</sub>)@w<sub>n</sub>. </p>

<p> Indeed, this works, but I haven't proved it yet because
I haven't demonstrated that it is well-defined. For this it
is enough to prove that if the first vector is zero then
the second must be as well. And now there
is a slight problem. We would like to make everything simple
by converting the question into one about bilinear maps, but
we find ourselves looking at bilinear maps on Ux(V@W), and
V@W is itself an object that we want to try to avoid thinking
about too directly. </p>

<p> Let us think, though, what a bilinear map f defined on 
Ux(V@W) is like. By definition it is linear in each variable
when the other is held fixed. So every u in U defines for us
a linear map f<sub>u</sub> on V@W by the formula 
f<sub>u</sub>(x)=f(u,x). But linear maps on V@W correspond
to <em> bilinear </em> maps on VxW: given a bilinear map 
on VxW we have seen how to associate a linear map on V@W,
and the reverse process is trivial - just compose it with
the bilinear map g:VxW--&gt;V@W. So it looks as though
bilinear maps on Ux(V@W) ought to correspond to <em> trilinear </em>
maps on Ux(VxW)=UxVxW. (That last equality is, strictly speaking,
a very natural bijection rather than an exact equality, since
(u,(v,w)) is not the same object as (u,v,w).) </p>

<p> This should interest us, because the definition of
trilinear maps on UxVxW makes no mention of how you bracket
the product, and that ought to help if we are searching
for an associativity proof. So let us try to make the
connection precise. </p>

<p> First, then, let us take a bilinear map f defined on
Ux(V@W) and try to associate with it a trilinear map e
on UxVxW. There is an obvious candidate: e(u,v,w)=f(u,v@w),
and it is easy to check that e is indeed trilinear. </p>

<p> As for the other direction, let e be a trilinear map
defined on UxVxW. It isn't immediately obvious how to
proceed, so let us remind ourselves what we do know: that
bilinear maps on VxW correspond to linear maps on V@W. Do
we have any bilinear maps on VxW? Yes we do: for each 
fixed u in U we can define e<sub>u</sub>(v,w) to be
e(u,v,w). This then gives us, again for each u, a
linear map f<sub>u</sub> defined on V@W by the formula
f<sub>u</sub>(v@w)=e<sub>u</sub>(v,w)=e(u,v,w) (extended
linearly). But now it follows from the trilinearity of e 
that the map f(u,v@w)=f<sub>u</sub>(v@w) is linear in u
for fixed v@w - and because we extended f<sub>u</sub>(v@w)
linearly, this is true of f(u,x) for more general elements
x of V@W. </p>

<p> We have now shown that bilinear maps on Ux(V@W) are in
a natural one-to-one correspondence with trilinear maps
on UxVxW. But a very similar argument will clearly prove
the same for bilinear maps on (U@V)xW. This observation
has solved our problem, because </p>

<p align="center"> u<sub>1</sub>@(v<sub>1</sub>@w<sub>1</sub>)+...+
u<sub>n</sub>@(v<sub>n</sub>@w<sub>n</sub>)=0 </p>

<p> if and only if </p>

<p align="center"> f(u<sub>1</sub>,(v<sub>1</sub>@w<sub>1</sub>))+...+
f(u<sub>n</sub>,(v<sub>n</sub>@w<sub>n</sub>))=0 </p>

<p> for every bilinear map f. By what we have just
proved, this is true if and only if </p>

<p align="center"> e(u<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>)+...+
e(u<sub>n</sub>,v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>)=0 </p>

<p> for every trilinear map e. But this, again by 
what we have just proved, is true if and only if </p>

<p align="center"> d((u<sub>1</sub>@v<sub>1</sub>),w<sub>1</sub>)+...+
d((u<sub>n</sub>@v<sub>n</sub>),w<sub>n</sub>)=0 </p>

<p> for every bilinear map d, this time defined on 
(U@V)xW. Finally, this is true if and only if </p>

<p align="center"> (u<sub>1</sub>@v<sub>1</sub>)@w<sub>1</sub>+...+
(u<sub>n</sub>@v<sub>n</sub>)@w<sub>n</sub>=0. </p>

<hr>

<p> Now let me give a slightly slicker, high-level 
proof of the same fact. We have just discovered the 
(not terribly surprising - none of these results are
supposed to be surprising) relevance of trilinear
functions on UxVxW. This strongly suggests that we
should do to trilinear maps what we have already
done to bilinear ones - that is, define a sort
of triple tensor product U@V@W. What should this
be? Well, presumably we would like a typical 
element to be a linear combination of elements of
the form u@v@w and for </p>

<p align="center">  u<sub>1</sub>@v<sub>1</sub>@w<sub>1</sub>+...+
u<sub>n</sub>@v<sub>n</sub>@w<sub>n</sub> </p>

<p> to be zero if and only if </p>

<p align="center"> e(u<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>)+...+
e(u<sub>n</sub>,v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>)=0 </p>

<p> for every trilinear map e. This can be done,
and since the proofs are very closely analogous to
those for products of two spaces, I shall not give them. 
Let me simply note that the universal property of 
U@V@W is that every trilinear map e:UxVxW decomposes
uniquely as hg, where g is the obvious map from UxVxW 
to U@V@W and h is linear. Moreover, any other 
space with this sort of universal property is 
naturally isomorphic to U@V@W. </p>

<p> In order to prove the associativity of @, it is enough to show
that U@(V@W) is naturally isomorphic to U@V@W. By the uniqueness
result just mentioned, all we have to do in order for this is to prove
that every trilinear map e:UxVxW--&gt;X factors uniquely through U@(V@W).
(More precisely, f=cg, where c is linear and g(u,v,w)=u@(v@w).)
How might that work? Well, for every u we have a bilinear map
e<sub>u</sub>:VxW--&gt;X given by e<sub>u</sub>(v,w)=e(u,v,w).  The
universal property of ordinary tensor products gives us for each u a
unique linear map f<sub>u</sub>:V@W--&gt;X such that
e(u,v,w)=f<sub>u</sub>(v@w).  Defining f(u,v@w) to be
f<sub>u</sub>(v@w) gives us a map f which is unique, clearly bilinear 
(we have seen this already) and defined on Ux(V@W). Hence, it factors 
uniquely through U@(V@W). </p>

<hr>

<h2> Yet another way of regarding tensor products </h2>

<p> There is one further way, which is useful as a psychological
crutch, but has disadvantages which I shall mention below. Suppose
that V and W are finite-dimensional vector spaces with given bases,
so that we can think of a typical vector in V in coordinate form
as v=(a<sub>1</sub>,...,a<sub>m</sub>), and a typical vector in W
as w=(b<sub>1</sub>,...,b<sub>n</sub>). Then v@w can be thought of
as the m-by-n matrix A<sub>ij</sub>=a<sub>i</sub>b<sub>j</sub>.
Notice that matrices of the form v@w are only a small subset of
all m-by-n matrices. In fact, they are the matrices of rank one.
For exactly this reason, an element of V@W of the form v@w is called
a rank-one tensor, and in general the <em> rank </em> of an element
x of V@W is defined to be the smallest number of v@ws you need to
add together to make x. This coincides with the usual definition of
the rank of a matrix. (Exercise: prove this.) </p>

<p> Why does this `construct' the tensor product? To answer this
question, let us prove the main fact. Just to avoid ambiguity, I
will invent yet another piece of notation - let {v,w} stand for
the rank-one matrix defined above, and let us show that </p>

<p align="center"> {v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>}+...
+{v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>}=0 </p>

<p> if and only if </p>

<p align="center"> f(v<sub></sub>,w<sub></sub>)+...+
f(v<sub>n</sub>,w<sub>n</sub>)=0 </p>

<p> for every bilinear map f defined on VxW. One direction is
trivial, since the map taking (v,w) to {v,w} is bilinear. As for
the other, if the first sum is a non-zero matrix A, then pick
(i,j) such that A<sub>ij</sub> is non-zero and define a bilinear
map f by f(v,w)=v<sub>i</sub>w<sub>j</sub>. It is clear that the
second sum is non-zero for this choice of f. </p>

<p> An advantage of this way of thinking of tensor products is
that it makes them easier to visualize. Its main disadvantage
is that it relies on a particular choice of basis. Not only is
there no canonical choice of basis for a general vector space
(even if it is finite-dimensional), but also the tensor product
can be defined for other algebraic structures where you don't
have a basis at all. </p>

<p> Rather than define these other algebraic structures, let
me give one example of a type of object which is not a vector
space, but on which a tensor product can be defined. Let G, H
and K be abelian groups, and write the operations on them as +.
Let us call a map f:GxH--&gt;K a <em> bihomomorphism </em> if 
f(g,h) is a homomorphism in h for each fixed g and in g for
each fixed h. We can ask ourselves what the most general sort
of bihomomorphism is, and we will find that we can answer this
question exactly as we did for vector spaces - either by 
considering all bihomomorphisms at once, or by taking the
free abelian group generated by all expressions of the form
[[g,h]] and quotienting out by the subgroup generated by 
expressions of two obvious forms. This will construct for
us a tensor product G@H, which will have the property that </p>

<p align="center"> 
g<sub>1</sub>@h<sub></sub>+...+g<sub>n</sub>@h<sub>n</sub>=0 </p>

<p> if and only if </p>

<p align="center"> r(g<sub>1</sub>,h<sub>1</sub>)+...+
r(g<sub>n</sub>,h<sub>n</sub>)=0 </p>

<p> for every bihomomorphism r. As a quick (and surprising if
you have not seen it before) example, let Z<sub>p</sub> be
the group of integers mod p under addition and let us work
out Z<sub>2</sub>@Z<sub>3</sub>. To do this, we must look
at what bihomomorphisms there are. Well, it is not hard to
see that a bihomomorphism r will be determined by what it
does to (1,1). But r(1,1)+r(1,1)=r(0,1)=0, as r is a homomorphism
in the first variable, and r(1,1)+r(1,1)+r(1,1)=r(1,0)=0, as
r is a homomorphism in the second variable. Subtracting, it 
follows that r(1,1)=0 and hence that r is identically 0. From 
this it follows that Z<sub>2</sub>@Z<sub>3</sub>=0. </p>
