\section{Forward Contracts}
\noindent A forward contract is something where we get a delivery and payment at a later time. Very much like an option, but the payment is done at $T$. It is written on a $T$ claim $\chi$ and contracted at some time $t$ with delivery at time $T$ is as follows\par
\begin{itemize}
  \item At $T$, the holder receives $\chi$ (the $T$-claim) from the seller
  \item At $T$, the holder pays $f(t,T;\chi)$ to the seller
  \item The so-called \textit{forward price} $f(t,T;\chi)$ is deterministic and is determined at the initial time $t$ in such a way so that the forward contract value 0 at $t$
\end{itemize}
\par\bigskip
\noindent When you enter the agreement, the underlying market may fluctuate but you are still bounded by the contract. Therefore, at a later time point, the price could be non-zero.\par
\noindent We want the price
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{gathered}
    \Pi_t(\chi-f(t,T;\chi)) = 0\\
    = \Pi_t(\chi)-\Pi_t(f(t,T;\chi))\\
    =\Pi_t(\chi)_\text{exp}\left\{-r(T-t)\right\}f(t,T;\chi)
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation*}\par
\noindent So $f(t,T;\chi) = \text{exp}\left\{r(T-t)\right\}\Pi_t(\chi)$\par
\par\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{Example:}\par
\noindent If $\chi =S_T$ (non-dividend paying asset, i.e in the standard BS model), what is its forward price?\par
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{gathered}
    f(t,T;\chi)=\text{exp}\left\{r(T-t)\right\}S_t
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation*}
\par\bigskip
\noindent Due to market fluctuations, once you have entered the contract its value may increase. So what is the value of a forward contract at time $s$ ($t<s<T$)?\par
\noindent We will receive $\chi-f(t,T;\chi)$ at the end of time, so the value is 
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{gathered}
    \Pi_s(\chi)-\text{exp}\left\{-r(T-s)\right\}f(t,T;\chi)
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation*}
