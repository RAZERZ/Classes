\section{Tips/rumors for the exam}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter 5, applying $nx^TS^{-1}x\sim T^2$ will come on the exam
  \item Be able to state assumptions of models such as factor analysis
  \item Scale invariancy for different things is good to know
  \item For distributions, be able to tell what happens during scalar multilication and addition of scalars
  \item (canonical correlation)$^2 = $ eigenvectors/values $\rho^2$
  \item Chapter 11; two class problems will come on exam
  \item Know the basic idea of LDA, QDA, logistic regression, RKHS, SVM, RF (when to use them)
  %\item Given scatter plot, we should have a feeling for which  
  \item Derive ECM (we have done Gaussian)
  \item Interpret dendrograms and output of k-means
  \item EM-algorithm is a \textit{must} for a higher grade
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Get expression of $Q$
      \item Explore how EM can be used if dsitribution is normal/expoonentional
      \item You should be able to explain how to get $Q$ and maximize
    \end{itemize}
  \item Find dsitribution or find normal
  \item R test (comunals, output, interpretation)
  \item 6-8 points 
\end{itemize}
