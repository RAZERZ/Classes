\subsection{Finding conformal mappings}\hfill\\\par
\noindent By this part, we know what a conformal mapping is, it just preserves angles (but not necessarily lengths) which is great since we can use this property to solve problems which we already have some ideas of how the answers should behave.\par
\noindent If we know that we want to find some conformal mapping between orthogonal curves, then we at least know that our answers will be orthogonal.
